The C library in ``OneDQuantum`` has two sets of building system:
``make`` defined in ``Makefile`` and ``Visual Studio``
solution file defined in ``OneDQuantum.sln`` and
``1DSchrodinger.vcxproj``. They are intended to be consistent,
so that the software behaves the same under Linux/macOS and under Windows.

For the Python code, the project complies with the PEP8 code style,
and for the C code, the project complies K\&R style.
